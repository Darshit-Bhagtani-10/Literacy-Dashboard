# 📘 Literacy Dashboard: A Data-Driven Insight into Bihar & Rajasthan

## 📖 The Story Behind the Dashboard
When I began this project as part of my coursework, I saw it as more than just another assignment. The dataset focused on literacy in Bihar and Rajasthan — regions that statistically trail behind in basic education metrics. What stood out to me wasn’t just the data, but the story behind the numbers.

My mentor wanted me to treat this project like a consultant would for a client in the public sector:
- Start by asking the right questions
- Use data to reveal the unseen
- And end by delivering clear, action-oriented recommendations

This was my chance to simulate a real business analyst engagement — using Tableau not only as a tool, but as a medium to bridge numbers with narrative.

## 🧠 My Role
This was an effort carried out as an individual project under faculty mentorship. I independently:
- Framed the analysis from a consulting mindset
- Interpreted educational and demographic data
- Designed and published a responsive Tableau dashboard
- Drafted insights and recommendations tailored to policy impact

## 🎯 Problem I Wanted to Solve
"What are the hidden structural barriers that keep Bihar and Rajasthan behind in literacy, and how can data help us address them?"

My goal was to:
- Quantify demand through age-wise population clusters
- Evaluate infrastructure (schools, computers) against population pressure
- Identify underperforming areas using visual patterns
- Propose data-informed steps to improve literacy outcomes

## 📊 The Dashboard
🎯 Live Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/darshit.bhagtani7496/viz/LiteracyDashbaord_DarshitBhagtani/Dashboard2?publish=yes

What it shows:
- Age-wise breakdowns of school-age population (6–10, 11–13, 14–15)
- Number of schools and digital resources available
- Region-level comparisons between Bihar and Rajasthan
- KPIs and charts built using Tableau’s Visual Vocabulary

## 📌 Key Insights
**Bihar**
- Population (11–15): 15M+
- Schools: ~27,000 | Computers: ~6,000
- Private schools dominate, limiting access for economically weaker sections
- Current literacy growth: ~25%

**Rajasthan**
- Population (11–15): 8.2M
- Schools: ~60,000 | Computers: ~40,000
- More balanced government school distribution, but regional inequalities persist

## 💡 Recommendations I Proposed
| Bihar | Rajasthan |
|-------|-----------|
| 🖥️ Mandate 1:50 computer-student ratio in public schools | 🧮 Reallocate tech resources to underserved rural areas |
| 🏫 Expand urban government schools to counter private dominance | 🤝 Promote public-private partnerships for school modernization |
| 📊 Introduce data tracking of attendance and literacy growth | 🎯 Launch real-time dashboards to monitor teacher performance and dropout rates |

## 📈 What I Learned
This project became a turning point. I realized that being a good analyst isn’t just about making dashboards — it’s about:
- Asking the right business/policy questions
- Finding stories within raw data
- Designing tools that non-technical stakeholders can use to take action


## 🔚 Final Thoughts
This dashboard wasn’t just a university assignment — it was an exercise in real-world thinking. It reflects my potential as a business analyst who combines technical skill with purpose-driven analysis.

If you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow analyst, I’d love your feedback. This project reflects the mindset I bring to the table — curious, detail-oriented, and impact-focused.
